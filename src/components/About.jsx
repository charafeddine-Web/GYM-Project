                            I am Ayoub Jaa, a professional sports training license holder and certified by renowned organizations such as the Royal Moroccan Football Federation. With over five years of experience, I have worked with various athletes in several disciplines including football, basketball, volleyball and tennis, as well as in combat sports such as MMA, judo, boxing and karate. My expertise focuses on physical preparation and nutrition, where I have helped many athletes achieve their performance goals. In combat sports, I have specifically worked with competitors to optimize their preparation, including weight management before competitions, through personalized diets adapted to their sporting requirements and lifestyle. In parallel, I have also guided individuals in their personal transformation through private coaching, aimed at improving their health and overall fitness.                                </p>
